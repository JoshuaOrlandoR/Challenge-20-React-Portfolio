  ## Description
  This is a react powered application that serves as a portfolio to show employers. To view, go here! https://joshuaorlandor.github.io/Challenge-20-React-Portfolio/ 
  <br>
  Please note, theres a lot of placeholder and one responsivity bug regarding the cards on the Project section. This will be fixed!
  ## Requirements
  This application just requires the link to view, it is not a practical application that serves a purpose for the average user. 

  ## Installation
  Users do not need to install this application, however, they can, if they want, run this page locally. To do so, download the repository and open it in a coding enviornment like VS code. In a terminal, run npm i and npm start, to install dependencies, and launch the page locally. Otherwise, just view the live app with the github pages link!

  ## Useage
  Users need only to use the link to view the application. 

  ## License

  ## Contributions
  As this is a personal project of mine, that I plan to continue to work on, I will not be accepting contributions to the code. If you would like to contact me, you can reach me via email! 

  ## Tests 
  SCREENSHOTS (Please note there is a bug right now with the project cards and how I styled them, they are the only non-responsive part of the page - will fix!)
